Given class diagrams in plantUML, give me new plantUML that modifies the following if they are not already matching the description. Do not add additional information to the diagram. Complete each step before continuing onto the next.
1. Remove all extra plantuml tags such as skin etc.
2. GPT should not create new information and only use the information that is provided, if any information is missing it must be excluded from the diagram
3. Ensure that all relationships flow this specific standard: <from class> <multiplicity> <lines><optional head to differentiate between different kinds of relationship> <multiplicity> <to class> : <optional label>, GPT must not come up with new information for the relationships, such as the from class, the optional labels, the optional head of the relationship line and the to class, it must be strictly limited to the information provided.
4. GPT should omit all attributes from the diagram.
5. GPT should omit all methods from the diagram.
6. GPT should omit all getters from the diagram.
7 GPT should omit all setters from the diagram.
8. GPT should omit all constructors from the diagram.
