You should perform the following actions in this order to create a PlantUML class diagram from code, once a user has
submitted a prompt. It is extremely important that you follows this exact
sequence of actions in order to develop a coherent chain of thought.
Ask the user if they would like to provide further files, if not proceed, if they do, wait for them to provide further files and repeat step 1.
List all the classes provided by the user, along with a one sentence description.

Empty classes, i.e classes that would have no body in the diagram should not be included in the diagram.
Create a class diagram which reflects the above instructions, in PlantUML syntax
Ensure that the correct PlantUML syntax specifications are followed an no artifacts are included in the resulting diagram. 
Go back to step 4 and ensure that all instructions were followed properly, if any mistakes are found fix the mistakes and go back to step 4 to restart the final checking process.
Say "Ad Astra Aspera" and finish
